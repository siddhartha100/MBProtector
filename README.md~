MBProtector: A Dynamic Memory Bandwidth Protection Tool. 

This tool is able to protect memory critical sections on any program. It modifies 
the program binary in order for that.


Building and running the tool: 





1. Installing correct linux kernel

In order to use this tool, first you need to install a specific linux kernel. 
This kernel contains necessary system calls needed for this tool.You can download 
that kernel from Github.Command is - git clone https://github.com/heechul/linux -b rtas15

During installation, you need to select BWLOCK option in configuration file.





2. Installing MemGuard 

You need to install MemGuard module in previously installed Linux kernel. Download MemGuard 
module from GitHub.

Commands are - 1. git clone https://github.com/heechul/memguard.git
               2. git checkout rtas15-bwlockv2
                
The procedure of building and installing MemGuard module are
               1. Goto memguard directory 
               2. Build it using "make" command
               3. Install MemGuard using "insmod memguard.ko" command





3. Building the tool( Procedure of builing the tool is same for profiling and MBProtector - Replace "MBProtector" with "Profiling" when building Profiling tool)

A. Goto MBProtector/src/pin-2.14-71313-gcc.4.4.7-linux/source/tools directory
B. Copy "MyPinTool" directory and save it as "MBProtector" directory
C. Copy MBProtector.cpp from  to MBProtector directory
D. Copy bwlock.h file to MBProtector directory
D. Open makefile.rules and modify "TEST_TOOL_ROOTS := MyPinTool" to TEST_TOOL_ROOTS := MBProtector
E. Go to MBProtector directory and run this command - make obj-intel64/MBProtector.so





4. Running the tool

A. Running Profiling tool
B. Running MBProtector tool

Run this command from Profiling directory - "../../../pin -t obj-intel64/Profiling.so -- path_to_your_application"
